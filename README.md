Just some dots
---------------------------------------------

uses [shtow](https://github.com/williamsmj/shtow) to symlink 

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/codereached/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
```

Run `install.sh` in the .dotfiles directory.
Then `dots` in any terminal to update.
Use `brewup` to run brewfile.

It uses antibody: `brew install getantibody/tap/antibody`
